# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the static assets used in the application, such as images and fonts.

## Images
- Place game icons here.
- Name them according to the references in `games.js` (e.g., `quiz.png`, `memory.png`, etc.).
- Ensure images are optimized for web use to improve performance.

## Fonts
- Add any custom fonts required for the application here.
- Include font licenses if applicable.

## Usage
To use these assets in the application:
1. Add the required images or fonts to this directory.
2. Update the relevant components or stylesheets to reference the new assets.

## Note
For the initial setup, the application uses placeholder colored boxes instead of actual images. To use real images:
1. Add them to this directory.
2. Update the `Games` class to use `<img>` tags instead of colored `div` elements.

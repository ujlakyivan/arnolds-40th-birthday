# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following:

## Images
- Place game icons here
- Name them according to the references in games.js (quiz.png, memory.png, etc.)

## Fonts
- Add any custom fonts for the application here

## Note
For the initial setup, the application uses placeholder colored boxes instead of actual images.
To use real images, add them to this directory and update the Games class to use `<img>` tags instead of colored divs.
